# LeetCode and UVA Online Judge Solutions in Python
This repository contains my accepted solutions in Python to problems from LeetCode. It also contains my accepted solutions in Python to some problems from the Programming Challenges (Skiena and Revilla) section on the UVA Online Judge platform.
Wherever possible, the code is well documented and my ideas for solving the problems are thoroughly explained. Furthermore, I include all the solutions I came up with to solve a problem and mark which ones were accepted and 
which ones were not due to time constraints.
